A bridge between **Webshare.cz** (premium account) and the ***arr stack** (Sonarr/Radarr). A single container that acts as:

- a **Newznab indexer** (`/torznab/api`) — translates Sonarr/Radarr queries into Webshare searches and returns the results as a release feed,
- a **SABnzbd download client** (`/sabnzbd/api`) — accepts a grab, downloads the file through your premium account into a folder, and lets *arr import it as usual.

## Getting started

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Then open **`http://localhost:9797/ui`** and walk through the first-run setup:
create your Websharr account and enter your Webshare.cz **premium** login
(just a username/e-mail and password — Webshare.cz has no API key). Websharr
generates its own API key for Sonarr/Radarr; you'll find it in **Settings**.

Environment variables (`.env`, all optional) can pre-fill the Webshare login
and pin the API key — values saved in the UI take precedence and persist in
`/config/settings.json`.

In `docker-compose.yml`, adjust the `/downloads` volume so it points to the same folder that Sonarr/Radarr sees (otherwise set up a Remote Path Mapping).

## Web UI

A monitoring and testing interface runs at **`http://localhost:9797/ui`**
(the bare domain redirects here; sign-in required, Sonarr-style):

<p align="center">

</p>

- **Queue** — live progress with **pause / resume** and delete per download.
- **History** — completed/failed downloads with retry and clear.
- **Search** — manual search whose **Grab** button pushes a release through the
  same SABnzbd flow Sonarr uses; results show container, resolution and length.
  When a grabbed file has no `SxxEyy`/year in its name, a small form asks for the
  series/season/episode (or title/year) so the import parses.
- **Log** — live backend activity, including the Sonarr/Radarr HTTP requests, so
  you can watch the integration from the browser.
- **Help** — the flow diagram and the Sonarr/Radarr setup steps below, in-app.
- **Settings** — Webshare account, API key, password.

For TV searches Websharr normalizes release names to `Series SxxEyy - …` so
Sonarr can parse and import even the many CZ files that ship without `SxxEyy`
in the filename. Some manual imports are still occasionally needed.

## Setup in Sonarr / Radarr

### Indexer (Settings → Indexers → Add → Newznab, Custom)

Add it as **Newznab**, not Torznab. Newznab is the usenet protocol, so Sonarr/Radarr
route grabs to the paired SABnzbd download client below. A Torznab indexer is treated
as torrent and its grabs would be sent to a torrent client instead.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| URL | `http://websharr:9797/torznab` |
| API Path | `/api` |
| API Key | copy from Websharr → Settings |
| Categories | 5000 (TV) / 2000 (Movies) |

### Download client (Settings → Download Clients → Add → SABnzbd)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Host | `websharr` |
| Port | `9797` |
| URL Base | `/sabnzbd` |
| API Key | copy from Websharr → Settings |
| Category | `tv` (Sonarr) / `movies` (Radarr) |

Host names like `websharr` work when everything shares a Docker network; otherwise
use the LAN IP and port. Also works through **Prowlarr** — add it there as a
**Generic Newznab** indexer (same URL/API path/key) and let Prowlarr sync it to
Sonarr/Radarr; the SABnzbd download client is still added directly in each *arr.

## Good to know

- **Shared download folder.** Websharr and Sonarr/Radarr must see the *same*
  finished-download folder, or import can't find the files. Mount the same host
  path into all of them, or set a Remote Path Mapping in *arr. Websharr reports
  paths under its `COMPLETE_DIR`.
- **Czech content and quality profiles.** Many CZ releases have no resolution in
  the filename; Websharr reads the real height from Webshare and labels them
  (`1080p`, …) so quality is detected. But a profile that blocks non-English
  (e.g. a *Not English* custom format) will still reject Czech releases — allow
  Czech (or use a dedicated profile) if you grab CZ content.
- Watch the **Log** tab to see the *arr requests arrive in real time.

## Czech titles (TMDB)

Sonarr/Radarr search by the title they know — usually the English one — but
Webshare files are almost always named in Czech (`bez.vedomi…`, not
`the.sleepers…`), so those searches find nothing. Websharr bridges that gap by
looking the request up in **TMDB**:

- Paste a **TMDB API Read Access Token** (v4 auth, from your themoviedb.org
  account) into **Settings → Czech titles (TMDB)**, or pre-fill it with the
  `TMDB_TOKEN` environment variable (the UI value wins).
- For each query Websharr finds the title in TMDB and searches Webshare under its
  **original title** (`original_name` / `original_title`) — that's where the
  Czech name of a Czech show lives — while keeping the canonical title for the
  release name so *arr shows and imports it correctly (e.g. it grabs `Bez
  vědomí` but reports `The Sleepers`). ID-based lookups are tried first, then a
  name match.
- For foreign titles Websharr additionally searches the **Czech alternative
  titles** from TMDB — the name a Czech dub is filed under (e.g. `Kačeří
  příběhy` for *DuckTales*), which is not the original title.
- **Search aliases** (Settings) are a manual override: map a title to the exact
  Webshare name yourself for the cases where TMDB has no Czech title or picks the
  wrong match.

The token is optional — without it, aliases still work and everything else runs
as normal; you just lose the automatic Czech-title resolution.

## Monitoring and notifications

- **Dashboard widget.** `GET /stats?apikey=…` returns compact JSON (active/queued
  counts, speed, failed count, Webshare VIP days) for a Homepage `customapi`
  widget or similar.
- **Prometheus.** `GET /metrics?apikey=…` exposes gauges
  (`websharr_queue_downloading`, `websharr_download_speed_bytes`,
  `websharr_history_failed`, `websharr_vip_days`, …) for Grafana.
- **Notifications.** Add [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise) URLs
  (Discord, Telegram, ntfy, Slack, Gotify, …) in **Settings → Notifications** or
  via `NOTIFY_URLS`. Websharr alerts on a failed download, when Webshare is
  unreachable, and when your VIP is about to expire (threshold `NOTIFY_VIP_DAYS`).

## Configuration (environment variables)

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `WEBSHARE_USERNAME` / `WEBSHARE_PASSWORD` | — | Webshare.cz credentials (initial default; editable in the UI) |
| `WEBSHARR_API_KEY` | auto-generated | API key for the Newznab/SABnzbd endpoints; set to pin a fixed value |
| `TMDB_TOKEN` | — | TMDB API Read Access Token for [Czech-title](#czech-titles-tmdb) lookups (UI value wins) |
| `NOTIFY_URLS` | — | Apprise URLs (comma-separated) for failure/VIP notifications (UI value wins) |
| `NOTIFY_VIP_DAYS` | `7` | Warn when Webshare VIP has this many days left or fewer |
| `SETTINGS_FILE` | `/config/settings.json` | persisted settings (UI account, Webshare login, API key) |
| `COMPLETE_DIR` | `/downloads/complete` | finished downloads (`<cat>/<name>/file`) |
| `INCOMPLETE_DIR` | `/downloads/incomplete` | in-progress files |
| `STATE_FILE` | `/config/state.json` | queue/history persistence |
| `MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS` | `2` | concurrent downloads |
| `SEARCH_LIMIT` | `60` | max results from Webshare per query |

## How search results are cleaned up

Webshare's fulltext is loose (OR-based) and matches on any token, so raw results
are noisy. For a TV query Websharr:

- tries `S01E05`, `1x05` and a bare `05` (common for CZ uploads) variants;
- for a season/episode search, requires the complete show title or alias,
  optionally a year, immediately followed by a numbering marker;
- rejects shared franchise prefixes: `Dexter Resurrection S01E01` is not
  `Dexter S01E01`; localized aliases and `S01.E01`, `1x01`, `1. série` and
  `séria 1 epizóda 01` remain supported;
- keeps only the **requested episode** (read from the file name), so a search
  for E05 doesn't return E01–E08;
- ranks by relevance, and labels quality from the real video resolution.

Only verified matches receive a normalized release name. A season search keeps
each file's episode number; ambiguous names such as `Dexter FHD CZ` or
`Dexter Resurrection 01` are omitted from a specific `Dexter S01E01` search.
Bare episode numbers are accepted only for season 1. Later seasons require an
explicit season marker, and their filename year need not equal the show's
premiere year. Search aliases match the whole title (ignoring leading English
articles), not substrings. A successfully resolved ID takes precedence over a
conflicting text query. These rules apply to both the Newznab feed and UI.

This intentionally trades some recall for safer automatic grabs. Files with
extra words between the series title and numbering may need manual inspection.
An incorrectly labelled file can still be misidentified: filenames are not
proof of the actual video content. A plain title-only search can return broader
results, but does not inject the requested season or episode into them.

Even so, because matching is filename-based, the occasional odd result slips
through — use Interactive Search / the UI when it does.

## Limitations

- Webshare searches **by file names only** — no metadata; result quality depends
  on how files are named. When *arr sends a TVDB/IMDb/TMDB ID directly, Websharr
  resolves it through TMDB (see [Czech titles](#czech-titles-tmdb)); note that
  Prowlarr converts IDs to a text query before forwarding, so behind Prowlarr the
  ID is unavailable and the TMDB name match is used instead.
- Interrupted downloads (restart, network outage, or **pause**) resume where they
  left off via an HTTP Range request; a failed job can be restarted via SABnzbd
  `mode=retry` (Retry in the UI History).
